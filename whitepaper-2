Decentralized Job Portal is a revolutionary platform that utilizes blockchain technology to connect job seekers with job opportunities in a secure and transparent manner. Our platform is built on the Ethereum blockchain and uses smart contracts to ensure that all job seekers and employers are verified before they can access the platform. This whitepaper will explain how our platform works and the benefits it offers to job seekers and employers.

Problem

The current job market is centralized and controlled by a few large companies. Job seekers often have to rely on these companies to find job opportunities and employers have to pay high fees to post job listings. This leads to a lack of transparency and fairness in the job market.

Solution

Our platform is built on the Ethereum blockchain, which ensures that all transactions are secure and transparent. We use smart contracts to ensure that all job seekers and employers are verified before they can access the platform. This eliminates the need for third parties and reduces the cost of posting job listings.
